## PyBank
The PyBank folder contains files needed to analyze the financial records which are in the file budget_data.csv in the Resources folder, which contains two columns of data: _Date_ and _Profit/Losses_. 

The PyBank folder contains the main.py file which is the python script that when run, analyzes the records within budget_data.csv. Once run, the script produces the analysis found in the terminal, and in the text dile analysis.txt, which is found in the Analysis folder within the PyBank folder.
